This version of the turntable assembly started off as a project to fix some parts of my Phoenixwan controller. As such, those are near replicas of Phoenixwan's assembly of the bottom translucent part and the top opaque part.

I would personally recommend you to use the V2 assembly version, but you can use this if you require more LEDs or you want to print replacement Phoenixwan parts.
