# kolyscon_IIDX
FreeCAD files for kolyscon_IIDX - a Double Player IIDX controller with AC-size turntables.

# General Info
This project was designed to be printable with medium-sized printers of 220x220 XY build volumes. Some parts are split and are modular, with fixation done via bolting and/or dovetail joints. Most of the controller properties are stored in a shared Properties file.

# Warning
* Do note that this is very much a WIP and a hacky project. Expect some degree of questionable choices and some boilerplate work needed for exports from FreeCAD. Not quite a kung-fu master of optimal FreeCAD project organization.
* Not exactly accurate to AC specs!! 1P and 2P buttons are not as long as on AC, I shrunk them down because it wouldn't fit on my desk otherwise.
* This con was designed with my own needs in mind. For example, it features translucent lightmeshes for lighting strips, which you may not need.
* If you ever decide to print it, with or without modifications, please assemble your exported models first to verify correctness of all parts.
